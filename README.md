# DAO Contract Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of our Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) contract. The DAO operates on decentralized governance principles, allowing token holders to participate in key decision-making processes.

## Token Creation and Distribution
### Minting
- Our DAO utilizes its own governance token, `GovToken`.
- `GovToken` can be minted and distributed to DAO members.
- These tokens represent voting power within our governance system.

## Proposing Changes or Actions
### Proposals
- Members holding a certain threshold of `GovToken` can create proposals.
- Proposals can vary from simple parameter changes to complex interactions with smart contracts.
- **Example:** Proposing a contract upgrade or a change in treasury allocation.

## Voting on Proposals
### Voting Mechanism
- `GovToken` holders are entitled to vote on proposals.
- The `GovToken` contract, incorporating `ERC20Votes`, allows for delegation of voting rights.
- Votes are weighted based on the amount of `GovToken` held or delegated.

### Vote Counting
- The system can employ various voting mechanisms, including simple majority or quadratic voting.

## Executing Proposals
### Timelock and Execution
- Approved proposals are not executed immediately but are queued in the `Timelock` contract.
- This introduces a delay, allowing for community review and intervention if necessary.

### Safety Feature
- The delay ensures that proposals are thoroughly vetted before implementation.

## Role of Timelock Contract
### Role Definition
- The `Timelock` contract is pivotal in the governance process.
- It controls the execution of changes post-voting period.
- It defines roles such as proposers and executors.

### Admin Role
- The admin role is capable of managing these roles.
- Initially held by the contract deployer, this role can be transferred or renounced for decentralization.

## Example Scenario
1. **Proposal Creation:** A member proposes a change in a protocol parameter.
2. **Voting Period:** `GovToken` holders vote on the proposal.
3. **Approval and Delay:** If the proposal is approved, it is queued in the `Timelock` contract, awaiting the end of the delay period.
4. **Execution:** Post-delay, the proposal is executed, implementing the change.
